Gensim is a free Python library designed to automatically extract semantic topics from documents, as efficiently (computer-wise) and painlessly (human-wise) as possible.

Gensim is designed to process raw, unstructured digital texts (“plain text”). The algorithms in gensim, such as Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Random Projections discover semantic structure of documents by examining statistical co-occurrence patterns of the words within a corpus of training documents. These algorithms are unsupervised, which means no human input is necessary – you only need a corpus of plain text documents.

Once these statistical patterns are found, any plain text documents can be succinctly expressed in the new, semantic representation and queried for topical similarity against other documents.
